#Working on my mongodb certificate

Building up queries on a express, mongodb app.

Write a program that will remove the lowest homework score for each student. Since there is a single document for each student containing an array of scores, you will need to update the scores array and remove the homework.

Remember, just remove a homework score. Don't remove a quiz or an exam!

Hint: One way is to find the lowest homework in code and then update the scores array with the low homework pruned.
